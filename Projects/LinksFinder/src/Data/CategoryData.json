    "Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a fundamental technology in web development that allows designers to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS is a styling language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It enables the separation of content from design, making it easier to maintain and update websites. CSS operates on a cascade principle, where multiple style sheets can influence the presentation of a document. Styles are applied in a specific order, with later styles potentially overriding earlier ones. This flexibility allows for global styling rules and local overrides.",
